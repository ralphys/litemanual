				<p>When it has finished scanning, you will see a dialog box 
				similar to the one below.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/hardware/ati5.png"></p>
				<p>For ATI, we would select: <b>Using Video Driver for the AMD 
				graphics accelerators from fglrx (proprietary) </b>(second in the list in the above picture)<br>
				Now click on <b>Apply Changes</b>. Enter your password when

				<br> You will then see this dialog as it downloads and installs 
				the driver:<br></p>
				<p><img src="img/hardware/ati5a.png" />&nbsp;</p>

				<p>When the driver has finished, click on <strong>Close. Now 
				restart your computer.</strong></p>
				<p>Now we need to make sure that our new <b>Menu</b> entries 
				launch correctly. Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Main Menu</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/hardware/ati6.jpg"></p>
				<p>A new window will pop up, select <b>Settings</b> on the left 
				then the first AMD menu entry on the right and click on <b>

				<p>When it has finished scanning, you will see a dialogue box

				<p>Generally you will want to select the current version, the 
				tested driver. In the above example we selected the <strong>
				Using NVIDIA binary driver (proprietary, tested).</strong></p>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you plan to play graphic intensive 
				games or you have a lot of Steam games, you need to select the
				<strong>proprietary, tested</strong> driver.<br>
				</p>
				<p>Now click on <b>Apply Changes</b>. You will be prompted for

				<p><img src="img/hardware/driverpassword.png" /><br>
				<br> You will see the following dialog as it downloads and installs:<br></p>

				<p>If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed
				output.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-01.png" alt="dual-m-01.png" height="352" width="880" /></p>
				<p>To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your
				work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI 'Settings
				Manager' instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration
				files.</p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu -> Settings -> Settings Manager</strong></p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-02a.png" alt="dual-m-02a.png" height="500" width="400" /></p>
				<p>Click on '<strong>Display</strong>' under the '<strong>Hardware</strong>' category.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-02b.png" alt="dual-m-02b.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>You will see each monitor listed on the left side of the window.  Click on one
				to change its settings listed on the right side.  Initially, both monitors will
				have the '<strong>Mirror displays</strong>' box checked.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-03.png" alt="dual-m-03.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check '<strong>Mirror displays</strong>'
				on the right.  Repeat the procedure for the second monitor.</p>
				<p>While one of them is selected, click on the '<strong>Position</strong>' drop-down box and
				designate the position you want for it relative to the other.  (To the right, or
				to the left of the other.)</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-04.png" alt="dual-m-04.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing
				the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-05.png" alt="dual-m-05.png" height="352" width="880" /></p>
				<p>Click '<strong>All Settings</strong>' to go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose
				'<strong>Desktop</strong>' under the '<strong>Personal</strong>' category.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-06.png" alt="dual-m-06.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>Whichever monitor the 'Desktop' settings window is on, that is the one it
				will apply to.  Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the
				monitor description changes according to which one it is on.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-07a.png" alt="dual-m-07a.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-07b.png" alt="dual-m-07b.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the
				wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted,
				but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click
				on one of the wallpapers.  You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-08.png" alt="dual-m-08.png" height="352" width="880" /></p>
				<p>If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen
				to '<strong>None</strong>' in the '<strong>Style</strong>' drop-down box.  (Remember - you need to have the Desktop
				settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.)</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-09.png" alt="dual-m-09.png" height="516" width="642" /></p>
				<p>Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper
				displayed and select '<strong>Spanning screens</strong>' from the '<strong>Style</strong>' drop-down box.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-10.png" alt="dual-m-10.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still
				have the panel stuck on only one of them.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-11.png" alt="dual-m-11.png" height="352" width="880" /></p>
				<p>To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings
				Manager window and choose '<strong>Panel</strong>' under the '<strong>Personal</strong>' category.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-12.png" alt="dual-m-12.png" height="513" width="785" /></p>
				<p>In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to '<strong>Span Monitors</strong>'.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/hardware/dual_monitors/dual-m-13a.png" alt="dual-m-13a.png" height="454" width="656" /></p>

is used for selecting profiles and misc settings.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio11.png"><br>
<br>
4. In the window above you can adjust volume settings for output. Using the blue sliding bars. You can toggle mute with the speaker icon <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio19.png"> It will change it's background color when active <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio18.png">. You can lock channels using <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio20.png"> 
so that when volume is raised or lowered it is done 
equally. Or you can toggle and set the volume to be louder on one side. The <img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio21.png"> icon is used to specify the default device used by 
PulseAudio. <br>
<br>
5. <b>Input Devices</b>, this includes microphones and other line-in devices, such as TV tuner cards with line in. Adjusting the levels and settings are the same method as described above in section

<br>
9. <b>Notes</b>: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to remedy this.

				<p><b><u>No Option to Install Alongside Windows?</u></b><br />
				If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions
				on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS-based computers using traditional
				MBR type partitions.  (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware <i>may</i> use
				GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit.  This discussion
				does not get into that.)  You will need to either eliminate one of the current 
				partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite.</p>
				<p>If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on 
				the 
				<a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">forums</a> for help before 
				proceeding.  Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition
				set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras
				that were part of the initial installation.  There may also be a recovery partition
				that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed.  If you
				went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then
				you can probably get rid of the recovery partition.  Same goes for the partition
				set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of 
				that.</p>
				<p>Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to
				shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as "C: drive").  
				If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux 
				Lite.  (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion.)  
				Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first.  
				Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is - un-partitioned.  
				Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager.  It is best done using 
				Linux tools.</p>
				<p>At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now
				offer the choice to install "Alongside Windows".  If it needs to it will create
				an "extended" partition that will serve as a container for the "logical" partitions
				needed for the installation.  (That is a way that is commonly used to get around 
				the 4-partition maximum rule.  As long as only 3 partitions are "primary", an 
				extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus 
				giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.)</p>
				<p><b><u>Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting?</u></b><br />
				If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may  
				allow for two modes of booting:  UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode.  
				There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive 
				in UEFI-mode.  In that case it will also be using the newer GPT 
				partitioning scheme on the hard drive.  (This applies mainly to 
				Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way 
				too.)</p>				
				<p><u>You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before 
				attempting the Linux Lite installation.</u>  The first thing to check is 
				whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows.  You should 
				be able to find that out by going to the "System" section from the 
				"Control Panel".  If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you 
				<b>will</b> be able to install Linux Lite.  (Only 64-bit versions of 
				Windows currently support UEFI booting.)</p>
				<p>If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in 
				either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate 
				further.  Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions 
				on the hard drive.  If you see a small partition near the beginning of 
				the drive, formatted as <b>FAT32</b>, labeled along the lines of 
				"System" or "EFI System Partition", then you have a UEFI installation 
				of Windows and <b>will not</b> be able to properly install Linux Lite. 
				If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned 
				disk and you <b>can</b> install Linux Lite.  If you need help figuring 
				that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that 
				to the <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">forums</a> 
				with your inquiry.</p>
				<p>Currently, we do not support UEFI installations.  You have two 
				choices if that is how Windows is currently installed.
				<ol>
				<li>Re-install Windows in BIOS/Legacy-mode first.  (Do not attempt 
				this without seeking help on a Windows forum!)  Then install Linux 
				Lite.</li>
				<li>Look for another Linux distro that does have UEFI support.</li>
				</ol></p>
				<br />
				<p><b><u><a name="install_multi-drive">Dual-Boot Install on Systems with More
				Than One Hard Drive?</a></u></b><br />
				When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computer
				with more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is
				to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive.  
				Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader
				will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader.  The Linux 
				boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot
				menu on start-up.  This is how most people do the installation.</p>
				<p>However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader in
				tact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own
				drive.  (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common
				being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove 
				the Linux installation.)  After the installation completes, they
				then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive.  Even
				though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it 
				will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it.  By
				booting from the Linux drive, you get the choice to boot either OS.  
				If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the 
				Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your 
				installation of Linux.</p>
				<p>To accomplish this, you must choose the "Something else" option
				from the "Installation Type" screen during installation.  On the 
				following screen you will set-up your partitions and mount points 
				manually.  Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the 
				"location for boot loader installation" to the MBR of the drive 
				containing Linux Lite.  For example, if you had two hard drives - 
				/dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location
				to /dev/sd<b>b</b> (without any partition number at the end).</p>
				<p>If you are not experienced with partitioning, or are unsure about 
				how to proceed, post on our 
				<a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">forums</a> 
				for assistance.</p>

<font size="4"><b><a name="report"></a>Create System Report tool</b></font></p>
				<p>

The Create System Report tool was created to better help people who experienced 
a problem with their computer. The report contains useful information about the 
hardware, network and software. The idea of the tool is to run it, then you 
would attach the generated file to a Forum thread with a title about the issue you are having. 
Lets get started.</p>
				<p>

Click on <b>Menu, System, Create System Report</b>.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport1.jpg"></p>
				<p>

A terminal will pop open, read the information in the window and enter your 
password when ready.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport2.png" height="477" width="778"></p>
				<p>

The report will take anywhere from a few seconds to less than a minute depending 
on your hardware.<br>
When it is finished you will see a screen like below.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport3.png" height="477" width="778"></p>
				<p>

You can see that it says, &#39;<b>The system report is located in your home folder. 
				Would you like to open the report now?</b>&#39;<br />
				Type 'y' to view it, or 'n' to close the window. Remember, the 
				report is now in your home folder and will be named something 
				similar to: '<strong>systeminfo-Friday-09-May-2014-22:56:50.txt</strong>'</p>
				<p>

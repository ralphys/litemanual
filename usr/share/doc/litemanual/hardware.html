					<p>If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed output.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-01.png"></p>

					<p>To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI <b>Settings
					Manager</b> instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration files.</p>
					<p>Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-02a.png"></p>

					<p>Click on <b>Display</b> under the <b>Hardware</b> category.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-02b.png"></p>

					<p>You will see each monitor listed on the left side of the window. Click on one to change its settings listed on the right side. Initially, both monitors will
					have the <b>Mirror displays</b> box checked.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-03.png"></p>

					<p>Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check <b>Mirror displays</b> on the right. Repeat the procedure for the second monitor.</p>
					<p>While one of them is selected, click on the <b>Position</b> drop down box and designate the position you want for it relative to the other. (To the right, or
					to the left of the other.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-04.png"></p>

					<p>Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-05.png"></p>

					<p>Click <b>All Settings</b> to go back to the main <b>Settings Manager</b> window and choose <b>Desktop</b> under the <b>Personal</b> category.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-06.png"></p>

					<p>Whichever monitor the <b>Desktop</b> settings window is on, that is the one it will apply to. Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the
					monitor description changes according to which one it is on.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-07a.png"></p>

					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-07b.png"></p>

					<p>When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted,
					but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click on one of the wallpapers. You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-08.png"></p>

					<p>If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen to <b>None</b> in the <b>Style</b> drop down box. (Remember - you need to have the Desktop
					settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-09.png"></p>

					<p>Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper displayed and select <b>Spanning screens</b> from the <b>Style</b> drop down box.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-10.png"></p>

					<p>Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still have the panel stuck on only one of them.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-11.png"></p>

					<p>To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose <b>Panel</b> under the <b>Personal</b> category.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-12.png"></p>

					<p>In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to <b>Span Monitors</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/dualmonitors/dual-m-13a.png"></p>

					<p>Congratulations, you have successfully set up and configured dual monitors.</p>

					<p><b>Input Devices </b>- this includes microphones and other line-in devices, such as TV tuner cards with line in. Adjusting the
					levels and settings are the same method as described above.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/sound/sound_config8.png"></p>

					<p><b>Configuration </b>- this lists known profiles for your sound card. In most cases there is no need to select anything here
					unless you intend to disable your sound completely, or have a unique profile setting, such as surround sound, mono, or stereo out.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/sound/sound_config9.png"></p>

					<p><b>Recording </b>- will list programs currently using an input method, be it line-in or a microphone. You can toggle access per program and or adjust volume
					per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned above.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/sound/sound_config10.png"></p>

					<p><b>Playback </b>- will list programs currently producing audio, or able to. You can toggle access per program and
					or adjust volume per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned above.</p>
					<p><img src="images/hardware/sound/sound_config11.png"></p>

					<p><b>Notes</b>: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may
					be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting
					settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to
					remedy this. You can find help by using the <a href="#sysreport">Create System Report tool</a> and using the directions to upload the generated report to the Forums.</p>

						<h2><a name="installissues">Installation Issues</a></h2>
						<p><b>No Option to Install Alongside Windows?</b></p>
						<p>If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions
						on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS based computers using traditional MBR type partitions. (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware <i>may</i> use
						GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit. This discussion does not get into that.)  You will need to either eliminate one of the current
						partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite.</p>

						<p>If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on the <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">Forums</a> for help before
						proceeding. Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras
						that were part of the initial installation. There may also be a recovery partition that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed. If you
						went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then you can probably get rid of the recovery partition. Same goes for the partition
						set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of that.</p>

						<p>Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as "C: drive").
						If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux Lite. (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion).
						Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first. Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is, un-partitioned.
						Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager. It is best done using Linux tools.</p>

						<p>At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now offer the choice to install "Alongside Windows". If it needs to it will create
						an "extended" partition that will serve as a container for the "logical" partitions needed for the installation. (That is a way that is commonly used to get around
						the 4-partition maximum rule. As long as only 3 partitions are "primary", an extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus
						giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.)</p>

						<p><b>Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting?</b></p>
						<p>If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting:  UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode.
						There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive.
						(This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.)</p>

						<p>You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before attempting the Linux Lite installation. The first thing to check is
						whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows. You should be able to find that out by going to the "System" section from the
						"Control Panel". If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you <b>will</b> be able to install Linux Lite. (Only 64-bit versions of Windows currently support UEFI booting.)</p>

						<p>If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate
						further. Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions on the hard drive. If you see a small partition near the beginning of
						the drive, formatted as <b>FAT32</b>, labeled along the lines of "System" or "EFI System Partition", then you have a UEFI installation
						of Windows and <b>will not</b> be able to properly install Linux Lite. If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned
						disk and you <b>can</b> install Linux Lite. If you need help figuring that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that
						to the <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">Forums</a> with your inquiry.</p>

						<p>Currently, we do not support UEFI installations. You have two choices if that is how Windows is currently installed.</p>
						<ul class="feature-grid">
							<li><i> </i>Re-install Windows in BIOS/Legacy-mode first. (Do not attempt this without seeking help on a Windows forum!)  Then install Linux Lite.</li>
							<li><i>  </i>Look for another Linux distro that does have UEFI support.</li>
						</ul><br>

						<h2><a name="install-multi-drive">Dual Boot Install on Systems with More Than One Hard Drive?</a></h2>
						<p>When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computerwith more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is
						to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive. Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader
						will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader. The Linux boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot
						menu on start-up. This is how most people do the installation.</p>

						<p>However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader intact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own
						drive. (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove
						the Linux installation.)  After the installation completes, they then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive. Even
						though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it. By booting from the Linux drive,
						you get the choice to boot either OS. If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your
						installation of Linux.</p>

						<p>To accomplish this, you must choose the "Something else" option from the "Installation Type" screen during installation. On the following screen you
						will set-up your partitions and mount points manually. Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the "location for boot loader installation" to the MBR of the drive
						containing Linux Lite. For example, if you had two hard drives - /dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location
						to /dev/sd<b>b</b> (without any partition number at the end).</p>

					<h2><a name="custll">Customizing Linux Lite</a></h2>
					<p>Linux Lite uses the XFCE desktop environment because it strikes a good balance between resource usage, functionality and customizability for the user. It's
					relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems.</p>

					<p>Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward, intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows XP or Windows 7
					environment are used to. At the same time, XFCE offers a variety of ways for people to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own
					tastes if that is what they want to do.</p>

					<p>That is what this section of the manual is all about. If you get bored with the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways.
					Linux Lite comes with a few themes and icon sets pre-installed already and switching to one of those is quick and easy. You can also download and apply other
					themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like. The panel along the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons
					can be customized in a variety of ways too.</p>

					<p>In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your desktop. (Over time, we may add examples to this page of additional programs
					that can be added to your system to spice things up a bit more.)</p>

					<h2><a name="desktop">Desktop Settings basics</a></h2>
					<p>Some of the most basic changes people like to make are changing the desktop background (wallpaper), deciding whether or not to have certain icons show on
					the desktop and sometimes they may want to change something about the menu shown when right or middle clicking on the desktop. <b>Desktop Settings
					</b> is where to look for making those types of changes.</p>

					<p>There are two ways to access the <b>Desktop Settings</b> menu. One way is to simply right click on the desktop and choose <b>Desktop Settings</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-01.png"></p>

					<p>Another way is to choose <b>Desktop</b> from the main <b>Settings Manager</b> window, which can be accessed by going to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-02.png"></p>

					<p>First, we will look at the <b>Background</b> tab under <b>Desktop Settings</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-03.png"></p>

					<p>By default, backgrounds are stored in the file system under the <b>/usr/share/backgrounds/xfce</b> folder. Images in that folder are shown as choices in the <b>
					Backgrounds</b> tab. Just click on the image you want and it will instantly switch to that for your background. If you want to add some
					of your own pictures to the choices, open your file manager <b>As Administrator</b>, enter your password, then navigate to that folder
					and paste your image into it.</p>

					<p>(<b>HINT:</b>  You can just right click your desktop, choose <b>Open as Administrator</b>, enter your password and it will
					open the Thunar file manager at your Desktop folder. From there, just navigate to where your picture is stored, copy it, then navigate to
					<b>/usr/share/backgrounds/xfce</b> and paste it in.)</p>

					<p>If you prefer, you can change the folder location that the <b>Background</b> tab defaults to for choices. For example, if you have a
					folder called "Wallpapers" under your Home folder, you can tell the system to look there instead. Click the drop-down box next to the word
					<b>Folder:</b> and pick <b>Other</b> to navigate your way to <b>/home/yourname/Wallpapers</b>. Some people prefer doing this
					because it eliminates the need to be <b>Administrator</b> when adding new backgrounds.</p>

					<p>There are a few other options associated with the background images. You can choose from different styles to display them in, choose a background
					color if they do not cover the entire screen, have the backgrounds change after a certain amount of time and whether or not you want to have the
					same background on each workspace. If you decide to have a different background for each workspace, uncheck the <b>Apply to all
					workspaces</b> box, pick a wallpaper for the workspace you are on, then drag the window to another workspace and select a new wallpaper for it there.</p>

					<p>Now let's take a look at the <b>Menu</b> tab under <b>Desktop Settings</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-04.png"></p>

					<p>Under <b>Desktop Menu</b>, it is asking if you want an applications menu to show up as a choice when you right click on the desktop and whether you
					want that menu to show the icons for the applications listed, or just their names.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-05.png"></p>

					<p>Under <b>Window List Menu</b>, it is asking how you want things to show when you middle click on the desktop. Here is an example showing how
					thing are listed using the default settings as shown above while a few program windows are opened on different workspaces.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-06.png"></p>

					<p>Lastly, under the <b>Icons</b> tab you can change various settings regarding the icons on the desktop - their size, whether to activate them
					with a single, or double click, etc. Under <b>Default Icons</b> you can choose whether or not to show certain default icons on the desktop.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/desktop/desktop-07.png"></p>

	      				<h2><a name="workspaces">Workspace Settings</a></h2>
	      				<p>If you are new to Linux, the concept of <b>workspaces</b> may be unfamiliar. Basically workspaces are virtual desktops that you can use to
	      				spread your work over. Linux Lite has two workspaces activated by default, but you can change that to any number you like. If you look to the right
	      				side of your lower panel you will notice two rectangles. Those are representations of your available workspaces as shown by the
					<b>Workspaces plugin</b> on the panel.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-01.png"></p>

	      				<p>Workspaces are particularly useful if you tend to have multiple programs open at the same time. For example, if you have two programs running in
	      				one workspace and want to open a few more, switching to another workspace gives you a fresh, clean desktop to put them on. This cuts down on desktop
	      				clutter and many find it easier to just switch workspaces rather than fumbling through multiple windows on the same desktop to find the one they
	      				want. Here are four screenshots that show the difference.</p>

	      				<p><b>First</b> - five program windows opened on same workspace.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-02.png"></p>

	      				<p><b>Next</b> - what you see when you switch to a new workspace.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-03.png"></p>

	      				<p><b>Last</b> - Workspace 1 with only two programs kept on it.</p>
	     				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-04.png"></p>

	      				<p><b>And</b> - Workspace 2 with three programs moved over to it.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-05.png"></p>

					<p>With your work spread out over more than one workspace everything is easier to see. Depending on your settings, switching between workspaces
	      				is typically done by either clicking one of the rectangles in the panel, using your mouse wheel while hovering over the rectangles, or using your
	      				mouse wheel on an empty spot of the desktop to scroll back and forth between workspaces. (Keyboard shortcuts can be used to switch workspaces
	      				also. These may vary depending on your keyboard layout, but a typical U.S. keyboard has <b>Ctrl+Alt+</b> the <b>Arrow Keys</b> set to move
	      				between the workspaces.)</p>

	      				<p>There are three areas where workspace settings can be changed. You can right click the <b>Workspaces plugin</b> on the panel and choose
	      				<b>Properties</b>. That brings up the <b>Workspace Switcher</b> window. Some setting are found there and others appear
	      				when you subsequently click on <b>Workspace Settings...</b>. In the example below, we will set up four workspaces and have the Workspaces
	      				plugin display them in two rows instead of one on the panel.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-06.png"></p>

	     				<p>You can also go to the main <b>Settings Manager</b>, choose <b>Workspaces</b> there and that will allow you to change the number
	      				of workspaces, their names and margins (if desired).</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-07.png"></p>

	     				<p><img src="images/customize/workspaces/workspaces-08.png"></p>

	      				<p>Lastly, there are some more workspace settings within the <a href="#tweaks">Window Manager Tweaks</a> section.</p>

	      				<p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>

	      				<h2><a name="litewidget">Lite Desktop Widget</a></h2>
	      				<p>The Lite Desktop Widget is available in Linux Lite 3.2 and above. It's purpose is to give people a basic
					overview of their system running including:</p>

					<ul class="feature-grid">
					<li><i> </i>Linux Lite Version</li>
					<li><i> </i>Date</li>
					<li><i> </i>CPU usage - average cpu usage across all cores</li>
					<li><i> </i>Memory Total - total memory installed</li>
					<li><i> </i>Memory Usage - total memory currently in use</li>
					<li><i> </i>User currently logged in</li>
					<li><i> </i>Updates Status</li>
						</ul><br>

	         			<p>The Lite Desktop Widget is disabled by default. Some people like this kind of information on their Desktop, some don't. To enable it, go to <b>Menu, Settings, 
					Session and Startup, Application Autostart</b> and place a tick in <b>Lite Desktop Widget</b>. Logout then Login and the Widget will appear at the bottom right 
					hand corner of your screen shortly after your Desktop has loaded. To disable the widget, untick <b>Lite Desktop Widget</b>. Logout then Login and the Widget will no longer appear.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget1.png"></p>

					<p><b>Transparency</b></p>
	         			<p>The only way to get rounded corners for the widget, is to enable Transparency. To enable Transparency, go to <b>Menu, Settings, Window Manager Tweaks, Compositor</b>, and place a tick in 
					<b>Enable display compositing</b>.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/transparency.png"></p>

	         			<p><b>Updates Status - a reminder to Update your system</b></p>
	         			<p>There are 4 states of <b>Updates Status</b>. The <b>Updates Status</b> is refreshed once every 5 minutes, so once you have installed updates, it will take 5 minutes to 
					display the new status in the widget. The widget does not display updates when they are available, it only shows when you last installed updates. For the <b>Updates Status</b> to accurately 
					display available updates, this would require root access and each user would have to be added to the sudoers file, this is a huge security risk and will not be enabled.</p>

					<p>The first state appears when you complete a fresh install Linux Lite, it will read <b>System never updated</b>. It's at this time that you need to update your system. 
					Go to <b>Menu, Favorites, Install Updates</b> to update your system.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget2.png"></p>

	         			<p>Once you have updated for the first time, after 5 minutes the <b>Updates Status</b> will change to <b>Your system was recently updated</b>. This message will also appear 
					within the first hour, each time you update your system.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget3.png"></p>

	         			<p>The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your <b>Update Status</b> every <b>hour</b> after the last update, as shown in the image below.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget4.png"></p>

	         			<p>The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your <b>Update Status</b> every <b>day</b> after the last update, as shown in the image below.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget5.png"></p>

	         			<p>After the <b>3rd day</b>, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your <b>Update Status</b> in <b>yellow</b> to remind you that it's time to update your system.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget6.png"></p>

	         			<p>After the <b>7th day</b>, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your <b>Update Status</b> in <b>red</b> to remind you that it's time to update your system, <b>urgently</b>.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/widget/widget7.png"></p>

	      				<p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>

	      				<h2><a name="themes">Themes &amp; Icon sets</a></h2>
	      				<p>The default theme for Linux Lite is <b>Arc</b>. The default icon set is <b>Faenza-Dark</b>.
	         			There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>.
		 			There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings - <b>Appearance</b> and <b>Window Manager</b>.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/themes/themes-01.png"></p>

	      				<p>Click on <b>Appearance</b>. Here you will see the <b>Style</b> and <b>Icons</b> tab.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/themes/themes-02.png"></p>

	      				<p><img src="images/customize/themes/themes-03.png"></p>

	      				<p>As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes on your computer.</p>
		 			<p>Click <b>All Settings</b> to get back to the main <b>Settings Manager</b> window; then select <b>Window Manager</b>. The
		 			<b>Style</b> tab will display available themes that tweak the look of open window frames and the minimize/maximize/close buttons in the windows.</p>
		 			<p><img src="images/customize/themes/themes-03b.png"></p>

		 			<p>Click through some of the choices to see how things change. Go back to the <b>Appearance</b> settings, pick a new theme, then come back to
		 			the <b>Window Manager</b> settings and go through choices again. You may notice that the <b>Window Manager</b> settings look slightly
		 			different depending on which <b>Appearance</b> theme you choose. Experiment with different combinations to find one you like.</p>

		 			<p>Close <b>Settings Manager</b> before moving onto the next part of this tutorial.</p>

	      				<p>This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons.</p>

	      				<p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>

	      				<p>Click on <b>All Settings</b> in the bottom right to go back to the <b>Settings Manager</b>.</p>
		 			<p>Now click into <b>Window Manager</b> and select <b>Redbird</b>. The new theme may not display properly until you log out
			 		and back in again, so do that now. Click <b>Menu, Turn Off Computer, Log Out</b>. Then log in again. Notice the difference between the

		 			installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click <a href="software.html#ppa">here</a> for more information on how to install
		 			a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility.</b></p>

	      				<p>The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on <b>View, Show Hidden Files</b>. Right click somewhere in your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>, make
		 			a folder called <b>.icons</b> if it does not already exist. (You will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/icons/icons-01.png"></p>

	      				<p>Download a mouse theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the
					<a href="http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Ecliz?content=110340" target="_blank">Ecliz mouse theme</a>.</p>

	      				<p><b>NOTE: Each icon set may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions.</b></p>

	      				<p>Next, extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click, <b>Extract here</b>).</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/mouse/mouse-theme-01.png"></p>

	      				<p>Copy the extracted mouse theme folder to the <b>.icons</b> folder in your home folder. Then open the <b>Settings Manager</b> and
	      				open the <b>Mouse and Touchpad</b> settings. Click the <b>Theme</b> tab and you will find your new theme there. Click to select
	      				it and your mouse will immediately change. Here is what it looks like.</p>
	      				<p><img src="images/customize/mouse/mouse-theme-02.png"></p>

	      				<h2><a name="mouse_pointer">Changing Mouse pointer size</a></h2>
	      				<p>Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Mouse and Touchpad</b>, click on the <b>Theme</b> tab. Select the <b>DMZ</b> theme (black or white, you choose) then adjust
		 			the mouse pointer size to your liking. It will change when you click close.</p>

					<h2><a name="panel">Customize your Panel Bar</a></h2>
					<p>The panel bar along the bottom of your screen, (with your Menu and various indicator icons on it), can be customized in a variety of ways. Its
					position and size can be changed. Launchers and plugins can be added to it. You can even have multiple panels if you want to position certain items
					on different parts of the screen. To get started, right click on an empty area of the panel and select <b>Panel, Panel Preferences</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-01.png"></p>

					<p>A <b>Panel</b> window will pop up where you can make your changes. The <b>Display</b> tab lets you choose to have the panel displayed
					horizontally, vertically, or as a deskbar on the screen. You can choose to auto-hide the panel or not, change its length and width and move it to the top,
					bottom, or either side of the screen.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-02.png"></p>

					<p>To move the panel you need to first unlock it, then you will see handles appear on either end of the panel that you can grab with your mouse to
					move it. Here is a close-up showing what the handles look like:</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-02b.png"></p>

					<p>The <b>Appearance</b> tab lets you choose a style for the panel, adjust the transparency (alpha) of the panel, or adjust the opacity of the
					panel depending on whether your mouse is pointing at it or not. ("Compositing" needs to be enabled in order to change transparency and opacity settings.
					See the <a href="#tweaks">Window Manager Tweaks</a> section for how to do that.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-03.png"></p>

					<p>The <b>Items</b> tab is where you go to add things like launchers, plugins and separators to the panel. Items on the panel are listed on the left
					and the buttons on the right allow you to change their position on the panel (up/down arrows), add (+) or delete (-) items, and edit details for them if
					necessary. As you do that, you can see the changes take immediate effect on the panel.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-04.png"></p>

					<p>Notice above that I created several launchers by using the <b>+</b> button, which opens an <b>Add New Items</b> window. That window
					is where you can choose to add launchers, separators, and plugins that are available for the panel.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-08.png"></p>

					<p>When you are done adding things, close the <b>Add New Items</b> window to get back to the <b>Items</b> tab of the <b>
					Panel</b> window. To assign a program to a launcher, highlight the launcher item and click the button for "Edit the currently selected item".</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-04b.png"></p>

					<p>That will bring up the <b>Launcher</b> window.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-11.png"></p>

					<p>Hit the <b>+</b> button to bring up a list of programs to choose from.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-12.png"></p>

					<p>As an example, below is a panel with various changes made to it.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-05.png"></p>

					<p>Note the following changes to the panel shown above:<br>
					- the panel was moved to the top of the screen.<br>
					- changed the Menu button to read as <b>Applications</b>.<br>
					- replaced the home folder launcher with a <b>Places</b> plugin.<br>
					- added various other launchers and two multi-level launchers (note the launchers with an arrow to their right side).<br>
					- Workspace switcher shows 4 workspaces in a 2-row format.<br>
					- on far right, a cpugraph plugin and an action button was added.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-06.png"></p>

					<p>If you are adding, deleting, or changing the positions of several items at once, it is probably easiest to do so from the <b>Items</b> tab under the
					<b>Panel Preferences</b> window as described above. You can add several things at once from the <b>Add New Items</b> window, then
					position and edit them from the main <b>Items</b> list.</p>

					<p>If you just want to add one item to the panel, you could also just right click an empty area on the panel and choose <b>Panel, Add New Items</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-07.png"></p>

					<p>That will bring up the <b>Add New Items</b> window where you can choose an existing plugin to add, or create a new launcher for an application on the
					panel. As an example, we will add a new launcher to the panel by highlighting it and clicking the <b>Add</b> button.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-08.png"></p>

					<p>You will see a new launcher without an assigned icon show up on the far right side of the panel.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-09.png"></p>

					<p>Right click on it and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-10.png"></p>

					<p>Click the <b>+</b> button to bring up a list of programs to select from.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-11.png"></p>

					<p>Find and highlight the one you want, then click the <b>Add</b> button.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-12.png"></p>

					<p>The launcher will now display the icon for the program you selected, but it will still be on the far right of the panel. To move it somewhere else,
					just right click it and select <b>Move</b>; then just drag it into position with your mouse.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-13.png"></p>

					<p><b>Creating a multi-level launcher,</b> (giving you a choice to start more than one program from a single launcher), is done in the same
					manner as just described. The only difference is that you add more than one item to the same launcher. One might prefer to make a launcher menu instead
					of separate launchers to save space on the panel and/or to group similar types of programs.</p>

					<p>In our example, the Firefox web browser has a small arrow to the right of its icon. We have installed two other browsers to the system and added them to
					the same launcher as Firefox on the panel. Here is what the <b>Launcher</b> window looks like after adding the three browsers. (Note that the
					one on the top of the list becomes the default choice and is the one whose icon is shown on the panel.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-14.png"></p>

					<p>On the panel, if you click the Firefox icon it launches Firefox. If you click the arrow to the right, it shows the other two and you can click either one to launch it.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-15.png"></p>

					<p>If you need a more detailed description of the procedure to create a multi-level launcher, please see
					<a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/index.php?topic=1294.0" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on our forum. The tutorial also describes
					some advanced tips like changing the position of the arrow on the launcher.</p>

					<p><b>Creating additional panels</b> is easy to do. From the <b>Panel Preferences</b> window, click the <b>+</b> sign along the top next to the <b>Panel 1</b> box.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-16.png"></p>

					<p>Now you will have a new (empty) panel showing on the desktop and the <b>Panel Preferences</b> window will show <b>Panel 2</b> along
					the top. With <b>Panel 2</b> showing, you can now go about setting your preferences for the new panel under the <b>Display, Appearance</b>
					and <b>Items</b> tabs. It is unlocked from the start so you can drag and place it where you like on the screen.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/panel/panel-17.png"></p>

					<p>There are many more panel plugins available for installation than those pre-installed with Linux Lite. Have a look on
					<a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/start" target="_blank">this XFCE site</a> for a comprehensive list of panel plugins that
					are available in the repositories. They are listed with their real package names, so you can easily use the search function in the <b>Synaptic Package
					Manager</b> (found at <b>Menu, System, Install/Remove Software</b>) to find and install any that interest you.</p>

					<h2><a name="tweaks">Window Manager Tweaks</a></h2>
					<p>Select <b>Window Manager Tweaks</b> in the main <b>Settings Manager</b> window.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-01.png"></p>

					<p><b>Window Manager Tweaks</b> are an assortment of other settings you can change that effect window behavior. They are organized
					under the tabs: Cycling, Focus, Accessibility, Workspaces, Placement and Compositor. We will just touch on a few of these settings here. The rest
					you can browse through at your leisure.</p>

					<p>The <b>Compositor</b> tab is of particular importance. It is here that you need to enable compositing if you plan to add transparency or opacity
					effects to your windows and/or panel(s).</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-02.png"></p>

					<p>Check the box to <b>Enable display compositing</b>. Now you can access various transparency settings for windows as well as enable some
					shadow effects. Here is an example showing the opacity of inactive windows changed. Notice that the window in the background is now slightly faded.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-03.png"></p>

					<p>With compositing enabled, you may now make transparency and opacity changes to your panel(s). Go to the <b>Appearance</b> tab
					under the <b>Panel</b> settings to make those changes. Here is an example showing the panel with full transparency, so icons appear to float on the desktop.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-04.png"></p>

					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-05.png"></p>

					<p>Back on <b>Window Manager Tweaks</b>, click on the <b>Workspaces</b> tab. Here you have a few more settings that control interacting with your workspaces.</p>
					<p><img src="images/customize/tweaks/tweaks-06.png"></p>

					<p>The options are pretty self explanatory. The last two options allow you to use your mouse to drag a window off one of the screen edges on to another workspace.</p>

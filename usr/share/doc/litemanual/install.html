					<h2><a name="installguide">Installation Guide</a></h2>
					<p>To install Linux Lite you will need to download the ISO file, then create either a bootable DVD or USB stick from the ISO.
					To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an "image" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will
					enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a
					reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX.</p>

					<p>Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting
					CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the
					computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific
					keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings.</p>

					<h2><a name="lldvdwin">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows</a></h2>
					<p>Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from:</p>
					<p>BurnAware Free - <a href="http://www.burnaware.com" target="_blank">http://www.burnaware.com</a></p>
					<p>CDBurnerXP - <a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/" target="_blank">http://cdburnerxp.se/</a></p>
					<p>ImgBurn - <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
					<p>Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will
					greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x speed is recommended if you have it.</p>

					<h2><a name="llusbwin">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Windows</a></h2>
					<p><b>Win32DiskImager </b>allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. Download it

					<h2><a name="lldvdusbosx">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX</a></h2>
					<p>To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: <b>df -h</b> It is usually listed as <b>media</b> or similar.
					Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is sdb another
					clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 15G. In this example my device is listed as:</p>
					<p><b>/media/jerry/9CB5-8A70</b></p>
					<p><img src="images/install/df-h.png"></p>

					<p>Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following:</p>
					<p><b>32bit:</b></p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">

					<h2><a name="prepareinst">Preparing your Computer for the Installation</a></h2>
					<p>If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the
					installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd
					like, then start the installation by double-clicking the <b>Install Linux Lite</b> icon on the desktop. When you get to the <b>Installation Type</b> screen, tell the installer to use the
					whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically.</p>

					<p>If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results.</p>

					<ul class="feature-grid">
							<li><i> </i>Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before.</li>
							<li><i> </i>Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the "C: drive"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation.</li>
							<li><i>  </i>Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time.</li>
						</ul><br>

          				<p>If you have <b>more than one physical hard drive</b> and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then
					we recommend you make a request for guidance in our <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">Forum</a> if you are unfamiliar with
					Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below.</p>

					<ul class="feature-grid">
							<li><i> </i>Choose "Something else" on the "Installation Type" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.)</li>
          						<li><i> </i>On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sd<b>a</b>, /dev/sd<b>b</b>, etc. - without a
          						partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.)  It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but
          						an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices.</li>
						</ul><br>

					<h2><a name="instllcomp">Installing Linux Lite to your computer</a></h2>
              				<p>Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first.
		  			This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information.</p>

            				<p>Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted
					with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/boot2.png"></p>

          				<p>Make sure <b>Start Linux Lite</b> is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that
		  			all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, <b>Start Linux
		  			Lite in safe mode</b>.</p>

          				<p>The other options are:</p>
            				<p><b>Check Install Media</b> - run this to check that the Linux Lite image is free from errors.<br />
		  			<b>Run memtest (memory tester)</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br />
            				<b>Boot the first hard disk</b> - boot the existing operating system.<br />
            				<b>Restart</b> - reboot your computer.<br />
            				<!-- <b>Shutdown</b> - turn off your computer.</p> -->
          				<p><b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through <a href="hardware.html#installissues">this trouble shooting guide</a></b>.</p>

            				<p>The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your
		  			hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in <b>linux</b> beneath <b>Other</b> and click on <b>Log In</b> (no password required).</p>

          				<p>Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click <a href="network.html">here</a> if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite.</p>

          				<p>Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite </b>icon on your Desktop.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/installicon.png"></p>

          				<p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the <b>Welcome </b>section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred
		  			language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll1.png"></p>

          				<p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by
		  			viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software
		  			during the installation.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: Generally we don't recommend ticking '<i>Download updates while installing Linux</i>' as this will significantly
					slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install  on today's hardware will take
					around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer.</b></p>

					<p><b>NOTE: '<i>Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware, Flash, MP3 and other media</i>'
					Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing
					media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this.</b></p>

          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll2.png"></p>

          				<p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to  your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer.</p>

          				<p><b>Install Linux alongside (Operating System)</b> - otherwise known as a dual boot. An option to boot from Windows, another Linux based operating system
					or Linux Lite when your computer starts.</p>

					<p><b>Note: If you want to encrypt your home folder, <b>do not</b> select the option '<b>Encrypt the new Linux installation for security</b>' instead, please follow these
					instructions <a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</b></p>

          				<p>It is not recommended to choose <b>Encrypt the new Linux installation for security</b> unless you are well versed in this method. The same goes for
					<b>Use LVM with the new Linux installation</b>. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are keeping it simple.</p>

          				<p><b>Erase Disk and Install Linux</b></p>
          				<p>Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on <b>Continue</b> to accept the changes.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most
          				people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to
         				keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the "Something else" installation type.
          				That way you can control the "location for boot loader installation" and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Again, this is not a necessity when
          				dual-booting. We point this out only because some people prefer to keep the Windows drive as is.<b></p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll3.png"></p>

					<p><b>Install Linux alongside Windows (dual booting)</b></p>
          				<p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the
		  			two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: Select Drive. In the main
		  			part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your
		  			proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then
		  			select Install Now after you have made the desired changes. If your computer has more than one physical hard drive and your intent
		  			is to install Linux to a separate drive from the Windows drive, see <a href="hardware.html#install-multi-drive">this section</a>.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll5.png"></p>

          				<p><b>Something Else</b></p>
          				<p><b>NOTE: FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY</b></p>
          				<p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for installation you may select <b>Something Else</b> and manually
		  			partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in
		  			the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are
		  			creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select <b>New Partition Table</b> from the options below. This will erase the
		  			disk and provide you with a clean slate. <b>WARNING</b>: This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to
		  			add a partition to the disk by selecting <b>Add</b> from the button options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk
		  			with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition
		  			size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a
		  			partition, you may select <b>Change </b>from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to
		  			be rid of, you can select <b>Delete</b> from the button options to delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its
		  			original state you may use the <b>Revert</b> button. <b>NOTE</b><b>: This will only work if you have not written changes to the disk.</b></p>

          				<p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr>,
		  			indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to
		  			install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader will intelligently add entries for installations of Windows and other Linux installs.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: If you have any NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation.</b> </p>
		  			<p>The mount point is simply "where" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever
		  			you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. <b>/myntfs</b> do not use <b>/My NTFS</b>.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll6.png"></p>

					<p><b>Where are you?</b></p>
          				<p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The
		  			installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time
		  			zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by
		  			either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll7.png"></p>

					<p><b>Keyboard layout</b></p>
          				<p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left
		  			and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later.
					<b>We recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the
					first time.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll8.png"></p>

					<p><b>Who are you?</b></p>
          				<p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include:</p>
          				<p><b>Your name</b> - your personal name.<br />
            				<b>Your computer's name</b> - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network.<br />
            				<b>Pick a username</b> - your user name that is used to login to the system.<br />
            				<b>Choose a password</b> - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password.<br />
            				<b>Confirm your password</b> - enter the above password again.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would
		  			be: <mark>y%9L2x#o</mark> would be considered a strong password. Use a program like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.keepassx.org/">Keepassx</a> to keep all your
		  			passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (Keepassx is available for installation from Menu, System, Install/Remove Software.
		 			You do not need to download it from their website.)</b></p>

              				<p>NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE.</b></p>

          				<p>There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login.</p>
					<p><b>Note: If you want to encrypt your home folder, do not select the option 'Encrypt my home folder' instead, please follow these instructions
					<a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</b></p>

					<h2><a name="encrypthome">Encrypting your Home folder</a></h2>
          				<p>After a new installation of Linux Lite, you have the option of encrypting your home folder for added security. You won't be able to
		  			encrypt your home folder while you are logged in. So we're going to add a temporary user then when we are finished, we'll delete that user.</p>
					<p><b>1.</b> Click on <b>Menu, Settings, User Manager</b>. Click on <b>New User</b> and add the user <b>tempuser</b> with a password of your choosing. Make sure you tick the <b>
					sudo</b> box on the right and click on <b>Apply</b> before closing out <b>User Manager</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt1.png"></p>

					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt2.png"></p>

					<p><b>2.</b> Now logout, and login with the user <b>tempuser</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt3.png"></p>

					<p><b>3.</b> Open a terminal and enter the following command to encrypt your home directory, replacing <b>user</b> with the name of <b>your</b> user account:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">

					<h2><a name="partdrives">Drives &amp; Partitions</a></h2>

					<p>Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding	what they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions.</p>

					<p>The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called
					<b>device nodes</b>, which are visible under the /dev directory.</p>

					<p>Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix <b>sd</b> is used
					for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively.</p>

					<p>A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as <b>partitions</b>. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the
					device letter signifies the number of the partion. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using
					MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary paritions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count.</p>

					<p>The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created
					by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes.</p>

					<h2><a name="mountpartdrives">Mounting Drives &amp; Partitions</a></h2>

					<p>Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not
					restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to
					write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on <a href="#automountpartdrives">Automount Drives &amp; Partitions for all users</a> section for other options.</p>
					<p>By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition.</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/unmounted-drives.jpg"></p>
					<p>As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and
					type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges.</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/mount-drive-authentication.jpg"></p>
					<p>Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive.</p>

					<h2><a name="automountpartdrives">Automount Drives &amp; Partitions for all users</a></h2>

					<p>A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive.</p>
					<p>The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as
					you may need.</p>

					<p>Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo mkdir /media/disk1</code></pre><br>
					<p>... where <b>disk1</b> is the name of the folder we are creating and <b>/media</b> is the directory under which it will be created.</p>

					<p>Then, open <b>Menu</b>, <b>Settings</b>, <b>Disks</b>. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on <b>Edit Mount Options</b> as shown below.</p>
  								<p><img src="images/install/mount/mdp-edit-mount-options.png"></p>
					<p>Set the following mount option:
					<ul>
						<li>1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options</li>
						<li>2- Check Mount at startup</li>
						<li>3- Mount options: users,noexec,nosuid</li>
						<li>4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you created in the previous step)</li>
						<li>5- Identify As: /dev/sdb1 (it may be sdb1, sdb2, sdc1 or similar - select from the drop down menu) </li>
						<li>6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ext4 ' (Linux) or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit.</li>
					</ul></p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/automount-ext4-disk.png"></p>

					<p>Optionally, you could also set a <b>Display Name</b> for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it.</p>
					 				<p><img src="images/install/mount/automount-ext4-disk2.png"></p>
					<p>Click <b>OK</b> to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so.</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/authenticate-to-set-automount-drive.png"></p>

					<p>Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users
					will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on <b>Mount selected partition</b> (little triangle
					in the Volumes actions buttons):</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/mount-selected-partition-button.png"></p>
					<p>The selected drive will then be mounted.</p>

					<h2><a name="mountcontrolaccess">Controlling Access to Mounted Drives</a></h2>

					<p>Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to
					automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a
					simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using <b>uid</b>, <b>gid</b> and <b>umask</b>.</p>

					<p>A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an
					interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users.</p>

					<p>The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission.</p>

					<p>Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives.</p>
					<p>First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is <b>liteuser</b>. Open Terminal and execute:</p>
  					<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
  					<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
  					<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">id -u username<br>id -g username</code></pre><br>
					<p>... where <b>username</b> is your administrator account username; <b>liteuser</b> in our case.</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/id-uid-gid.png"></p>

					<p>For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need:</p>
					<p><b>umask 222</b> - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account.</p>
					<p><b>umask 077</b> - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or
					directories.</p>
					<p><b>umask 022</b> - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search
					access to your directories.</p>
					<p><b>umask 002</b> - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only
					to your files, and read/search to your directories.</p>

					<p>Using <b>Menu</b>, <b>Settings</b>, <b>Disks</b>, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077:</p>
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/mount-uid-gid-umask.png"></p>
					<p>With the above mount options, this is what <b>liteuser</b> and <b>user1</b> accounts get to access.</p>
									<div style="text-align: left;">
									<div style="display: inline-block; margin-right: 5px;">
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/permissions-liteuser.png" /></p>
									</div>
					 				<div style="display: inline-block;">
									<p><img src="images/install/mount/permissions-user1.png" /></p>
									</div>
									</div>

					<h2><a name="adduser">Adding another User</a></h2>
          				<p>To add another User to Linux Lite, click on <b>Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager</b>. Then click on <b>Add New User</b> and enter a name, and the same password twice.</p>
          				<p><b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be:</p>
						<div class="codeheader"></div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">y%9L2x#o</code></pre><br>

					<p>would be considered a strong password. Use a program like <a target="_blank"
                			href="https://www.keepassx.org/">Keepassx</a> to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts.</p>
              				<p>Never compromise your security for convenience.</b></p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/user/liteuser1.png"></p>

          				<p>You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on <b>Ok</b> to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the
		  			same rights as the default user (you) <b>except for Administrator rights</b> meaning they will be unable to modify system settings
		  			such as installing software and changing system files.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/user/liteuser2.png"></p>

          				<p><a name="userperms"></a><b>User Permissions</b></p>
          				<p>If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to <b>sudo</b>, place a tick in
		  			the box beside it and click on <b>Apply</b>. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out
		  			of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in,
		  			they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'.</p>

          				<h2><a name="userdel">Removing a User</a></h2>
          				<p><b>NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account
		  			also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc.</b></p>
          				<p>This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the <b>Select user</b> drop down box, clicking on <b>Remove selected user</b> and clicking on <b>Apply</b>.
					If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click <b>Ok</b>. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on <b>Yes</b>.
		  			The user account and all their data has now been removed.</p>

					<h2><a name="respassword">Resetting your Password</a></h2>
          				<p>Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin.</p>

					<h2><a name="termbasics">Terminal Basics</a></h2>
          				<p>Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions
		  			where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that
		  			will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to.</p>

          				<p><b>TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto
		  			complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below
		  			'directory' also means 'folder'.</b></p>

		    			<p>When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command
		    			listed below, "<b>pwd</b>". It will show that you are in "/home/username", where "username" is your actual username.</p>
		    			<p><b>pwd</b> - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type "pwd" and it will tell you where you
		   			are in the file system.</p>

		    			<p><b>ls</b> - display a list of files and directories in the current directory</p>
          				<p><b>ls -la</b> - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties.</p>
          				<p><b>cd</b> - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder,
          				type:  <b>cd Documents</b>. If you then type <b>pwd</b>, you will see that your location is now <b>/home/username/Documents</b>.</p>
          				<p><b>cd ..</b> - go back one directory (up to parent directory of your current location).</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/termbasics/term-basics1.png"></p>

          				<p><b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory</p>
          				<p><b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory</p>
          				<p><b>rm -rf</b> - permanently delete a file or directory</p>
          				<p><b>mv</b> - rename a file or directory.<br /> You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. <b>mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents</b></p>
          				<p><b>cat</b> - display the contents inside a file</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/termbasics/term-basics2.png"></p>

          				<p><b>mkdir</b> - make a new folder</p>
          				<p><b>rmdir</b> - remove a folder</p>
          				<p><b>killall</b> - kill a program with that name</p>
          				<p><b>man</b> - read the manual for a particular program (type <b>q</b> to exit the manual)</p>

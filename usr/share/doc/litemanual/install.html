					<h2><a name="installguide">Installation Guide</a></h2>
					<p>To install Linux Lite you will need to download the ISO file, then create either a bootable DVD or USB stick from the ISO.
					To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an "image" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will
					enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a
					reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX.</p>

					<p>Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting
					CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the
					computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific
					keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings.</p>

					<h2><a name="lldvdwin">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows</a></h2>
					<p>Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from:</p>
					<p>BurnAware Free - <a href="http://www.burnaware.com" target="_blank">http://www.burnaware.com</a></p>
					<p>CDBurnerXP - <a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/" target="_blank">http://cdburnerxp.se/</a></p>
					<p>ImgBurn - <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
					<p>Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will
					greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x speed is recommended if you have it.</p>

					<h2><a name="llusbwin">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Windows</a></h2>
					<p><b>Win32DiskImager </b>allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. Download it
					from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<h2><a name="lldvdusbosx">Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX</a></h2>
					<p>To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: <b>df -h</b> It is usually listed as <b>media</b> or similar.
					Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is sdb another
					clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 15G. In this example my device is a TDK 15gb USB stick.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/df-h.png"></p>

					<p>Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following:</p>
					<p><b>32bit:</b></p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo dd if=linux-lite-3.2-32bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M</code></pre><br>

						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo dd if=linux-lite-3.2-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M</code></pre><br>

					<p>Change the <b>x</b> in <b>sdx</b> to match the letter of your USB device.</p>
					<p>The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually.</p>

					<h2><a name="prepareinst">Preparing your Computer for the Installation</a></h2>
					<p>If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the
					installation - even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd
					like, then start the installation by double-clicking the <b>Install</b> icon on the desktop. When you get to the <b>Installation Type</b> screen, tell the installer to use the
					whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically.</p>

					<p>If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results.</p>

					<ul class="feature-grid">
							<li><i> </i>Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before.</li>
							<li><i> </i>Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the "C: drive"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation.</li>
							<li><i>  </i>Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.)</li>
							<li><i>  </i>If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time.</li>
						</ul><br>

          				<p>If you have <b><u>more than one</u> physical hard drives</b> and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux on its own dedicated physical drive, then
					we recommend you make a request for guidance in our <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/" target="_blank">Forum</a> if you are unfamiliar with
					Linux installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below.</p>

					<ul class="feature-grid">
							<li><i> </i>Choose "Something else" on the "Installation Type" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.)</li>
          						<li><i> </i>On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sd<b>a</b>, /dev/sd<b>b</b>, etc. - without a
          						partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.)  It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but
          						an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive.</li>
          						<li><i> </i>Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices.</li>
						</ul><br>

					<h2><a name="instllcomp">Installing Linux Lite to your computer</a></h2>
              				<p>Start your computer, and go into your system Bios and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first.
		  			This varies from bios to bios. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information.</p>

            				<p>Once you are happy with your bios set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted
					with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/boot2.png"></p>

          				<p>Make sure <b>Start Linux Lite</b> is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that
		  			all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, <b>Start Linux
		  			Lite in safe graphics mode</b>.</p>

          				<p>The other options are:</p>
            				<p><b>Check Install Media</b> - run this to check that the Linux Lite image is free from errors.<br />
		  			<b>Run memtest</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br />
            				<b>Boot the first hard disk</b> - boot the existing operating system.<br />
            				<b>Restart</b> - reboot your computer.<br />
            				<!-- <b>Shutdown</b> - turn off your computer.</p> -->
          				<p><b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through <a href="hardware.html#installissues">this trouble shooting guide</a></b>.</p>

            				<p>The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your
		  			hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. An explanation of the various Menu's can be found by
		  			clicking <a href="start.html#menus">here</a>.</p>

          				<p>Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click <a href="network.html">here</a> if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite.</p>

          				<p>Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite </b>icon on your Desktop.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/installicon.png"></p>

          				<p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the <b>Welcome </b>section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred
		  			language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll1.png"></p>

          				<p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by
		  			viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software
		  			during the installation.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: Generally we don't recommend ticking 'Download updates while installing Linux' as this will significantly
					slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install  on today's hardware will take
					around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer.</b></p>

					<p><b>NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware, Flash, MP3 and other media' 
					Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing 
					media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this.</b></p>

          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll2.png"></p>

          				<p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to  your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer.</p>

          				<p><b>Install Linux alongside (Operating System)</b> - otherwise known as a dual boot. An option to boot from Windows, another Linux based operating system 
					or Linux Lite when your computer starts.</p>

					<p><b>Note: If you want to encrypt your home folder, <b>do not</b> select the option '<b>Encrypt the new Linux installation for security</b>' instead, please follow these
					instructions <a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</b></p>

          				<p>It is not recommended to choose <b>Encrypt the new Linux installation for security</b> unless you are well versed in this method. The same goes for 
					<b>Use LVM with the new Linux installation</b>. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are keeping it simple.</p>

          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll3.png"></p>

          				<p><b>Erase Disk and Install Linux</b></p>
          				<p>Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on <b>Continue</b> to accept the changes.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most
          				people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to
         				keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the "Something else" installation type.
          				That way you can control the "location for boot loader installation" and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Again, this is not a necessity when
          				dual-booting. We point this out only because some people prefer to keep the Windows drive as is.<b></p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll4.png"></p>

					<p><b>Install Linux alongside Windows (dual booting)</b></p>
          				<p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the
		  			two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: Select Drive. In the main
		  			part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your
		  			proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then
		  			select Install Now after you have made the desired changes. If your computer has more than one physical hard drive and your intent
		  			is to install Linux to a separate drive from the Windows drive, see <a href="hardware.html#install-multi-drive">this section</a>.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll5.png"></p>

          				<p><b>Something Else</b></p>
          				<p><b>NOTE: FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY</b></p>
          				<p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for installation you may select <b>Something Else</b> and manually
		  			partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in
		  			the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are
		  			creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select <b>New Partition Table</b> from the options below. This will erase the
		  			disk and provide you with a clean slate. <b>WARNING</b>: This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to
		  			add a partition to the disk by selecting <b>Add</b> from the button options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk
		  			with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition
		  			size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a
		  			partition, you may select <b>Change </b>from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to
		  			be rid of, you can select <b>Delete</b> from the button options to delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its
		  			original state you may use the <b>Revert</b> button. <b>NOTE</b><b>: This will only work if you have not written changes to the disk.</b></p>

          				<p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr>,
		  			indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to
		  			install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader will intelligently add entries for installations of Windows and other Linux installs.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: If you have any NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation.</b> </p>
		  			<p>The mount point is simply "where" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever
		  			you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. <b>/myntfs</b> do not use <b>/My NTFS</b>.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll6.jpg"></p>

					<p><b>Where are you?</b></p>
          				<p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The
		  			installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time
		  			zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by
		  			either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll7.png"></p>

					<p><b>Keyboard layout</b></p>
          				<p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left
		  			and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. 
					<b>We recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the 
					first time.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll8.png"></p>

					<p><b>Who are you?</b></p>
          				<p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include:</p>
          				<p><b>Your name</b> - your personal name.<br />
            				<b>Your computer's name</b> - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network.<br />
            				<b>Pick a username</b> - your user name that is used to login to the system.<br />
            				<b>Choose a password</b> - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password.<br />
            				<b>Confirm your password</b> - enter the above password again.</p>

          				<p><b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would
		  			be: <mark>y%9L2x#o</mark> would be considered a strong password. Use a program like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.keepassx.org/">Keepassx</a> to keep all your
		  			passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (Keepassx is available for installation from Menu, System, Install/Remove Software.
		 			You do not need to download it from their website.)</b></p>

              				<p>NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE.</b></p>

          				<p>There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login.</p>
					<p><b>Note: If you want to encrypt your home folder, do not select the option 'Encrypt my home folder' instead, please follow these instructions
					<a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</b></p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/installwizard/install-ll9.png"></p>

          				<p>If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to <b>Take a photo</b> this feature is supported so that when you
		  			first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to <b>.face</b>
           				and place it in your <b>/home/user</b> folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon.</p>

					<p>After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included
		  			in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the
		  			window (the picture below may vary from version to version).</p>

					<h2><a name="encrypthome">Encrypting your Home folder</a></h2>
          				<p>After a new installation of Linux Lite, you have the option of encrypting your home folder for added security. You won't be able to
		  			encrypt your home folder while you are logged in. So we're going to add a temporary user then when we are finished, we'll delete that user.</p>
					<p><b>1.</b> Click on <b>Menu, Settings, User Manager</b>. Click on <b>New User</b> and add the user <b>tempuser</b> with a password of your choosing. Make sure you tick the <b>
					sudo</b> box on the right and click on <b>Apply</b> before closing out <b>User Manager</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt1.png"></p>

					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt2.png"></p>

					<p><b>2.</b> Now logout, and login with the user <b>tempuser</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt3.png"></p>

					<p><b>3.</b> Open a terminal and enter the following command to encrypt your home directory, replacing <b>user</b> with the name of <b>your</b> user account:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u user</code></pre><br>

					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt4.png"></p>

					<p><b>4.</b> When this has finished (time to encrypt may vary) <b>you must logout of tempuser and login as your user. DO NOT Reboot.</b></p>
					<p><b>5.</b> Once logged in as your user, open a terminal and type in:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">ecryptfs-add-passphrase</code></pre><br>

					<p>and enter your login password.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt5.png"></p>

					<p><b>6.</b> To check that you have successfully created a passphrase, enter the command:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase</code></pre><br>

					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt6.png"></p>

					<p><b>7.</b> Clean up time. Open a terminal and enter the following commands:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo userdel tempuser</code></pre><br>

						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo rm -rf /home/yourusername.3redf/</code></pre><br>

					<p>When you do the last command, type a dot '.' after your username and press the tab key to complete the directory name.</p>
					<p><b>Note: Be extremely careful when doing this last command, you run the risk of deleting your home folder if you do not follow these instructions to the letter.</b></p>
					<p><img src="images/install/encrypt/encrypt7.png"></p>

					<p>Your home folder should now be encrypted. To test, insert a live linux operating system cd/usb and reboot. Once you are in the live
					desktop, you shouldn't be able to browse your encrypted home folder.</p>

          				<p><img src="images/install/lang/lang8.png"></p>

          				<p><b>8.</b> Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied.</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/lang/lang9.png"></p>

          				<p>Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in <b>Install/Remove Software</b> and see if there is a language
		  			pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the <b>Menu</b> items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way
		  			to rename <b>Menu</b> entries is by going to <b>Menu, Settings, Main Menu</b> and editing the entries there.</p>

					<h2><a name="enabletrim">Enabling TRIM on your SSD</a></h2>
          				<p>Enabling trim on your SSD will significantly increase its life span. Here's how to do it on Linux Lite.</p>

					<p><b>CAUTION: You MUST edit the following file with great care, a misplaced comma, a gap that shouldn't be there or a missing
					line will cause you computer to not boot. Take your time and triple check this file for accuracy before saving it.</b></p>

					<p>Open a terminal and do:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">

						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo leafpad /etc/fstab</code></pre><br>

					<p>a file will open that will look similar to this:</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/trim/trim1.png"></p>

					<p>Look for every line that contains the word <b>ext4</b>.</p>
					<p>At the start on the next block of information, place the characters <b>noatime,</b> (don't forget the <b>comma</b>) in front.</p>
					<p><b>Do not</b> enable Trim on the swap line.</p>
					<p><b>Do not</b> place <b>noatime,</b> on partitions or drives that are not on the SSD, eg. IDE or regular hard drives.</p>
					<p><img src="images/install/trim/trim2.png"></p>
						
					<p>Now save and close the file.</p>
					<p>Now open a terminal and do:</p>
						<div class="codeheader">Terminal Command:</div>
						<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
						<code style="overflow: scroll;" class="bbc_code">sudo leafpad /etc/rc.local</code></pre><br>

					<p>Above the line <b>exit 0</b> in that file, add the TRIM command <b>fstrim -v</b> for every EXT4 partition from your fstab file.</p>
					<p>Copy the text below and edit it to match your set up. We include the creation of a log for you so you can check if trim is performed during boot up. The log is in <b>/var/log/trim.log</b></p>

					<table width="800" id="table1" bgcolor="#FFFF55">

		  			'where' in the file system you want the partition's files to show up. Most people like to see them in their Home folder, so that is what the
		  			following examples depict.</p>

          				<p><b>NTFS</b></p>

					<h2><a name="termbasics">Terminal Basics</a></h2>
          				<p>Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions
		  			where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that
		  			will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to.</p>

          				<p><b>TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto
		  			complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below
		  			'directory' also means 'folder'.</b></p>

		    			<p>When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command
		    			listed below, "<b>pwd</b>". It will show that you are in "/home/username", where "username" is your actual username.</p>
		    			<p><b>pwd</b> - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type "pwd" and it will tell you where you
		   			are in the file system.</p>

		    			<p><b>ls</b> - display a list of files and directories in the current directory</p>
          				<p><b>ls -la</b> - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties.</p>
          				<p><b>cd</b> - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder,
          				type:  <b>cd Documents</b>. If you then type <b>pwd</b>, you will see that your location is now <b>/home/username/Documents</b>.</p>
          				<p><b>cd ..</b> - go back one directory (up to parent directory of your current location).</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/termbasics/term-basics1.png"></p>

          				<p><b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory</p>
          				<p><b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory</p>
          				<p><b>rm -rf</b> - permanently delete a file or directory</p>
          				<p><b>mv</b> - rename a file or directory.<br /> You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. <b>mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents</b></p>
          				<p><b>cat</b> - display the contents inside a file</p>
          				<p><img src="images/install/termbasics/term-basics2.png"></p>

          				<p><b>mkdir</b> - make a new folder</p>
          				<p><b>rmdir</b> - remove a folder</p>
          				<p><b>killall</b> - kill a program with that name</p>
          				<p><b>man</b> - read the manual for a particular program (type <b>q</b> to exit the manual)</p>

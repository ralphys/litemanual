					<p>This page is a work in progress. Over time more tutorials will be added to it. Some of them may deal with software that is already included in the
					standard Linux Lite installation. Many will be for software that needs to be installed first because it is not part of the standard installation. Two
					choices listed under <b>Menu, System</b> will be used frequently for installing software.</p>

					<p><h2><a name="systemback">Systemback</a></h2></p>

					<p>Systemback allows you to create restore points and live ISO images of your system. Just like on Windows, you can create a restore point, and then restore from one.</p>

					<p><b><a name="systembackres">Creating a Restore Point</a></b></p>

					<p><b>NOTE:</b> Creating a restore point <b>does not</b> save all your documents, pictures, videos etc. It <b>only</b> backs up your <b>applications</b>. You must back up your personal files first 
					via <b>Menu, Accessories, Backups</b> before creating a restore point.</p>

					<p>Click on <b>Menu, System, Systemback</b>. Enter your password and click on <b>OK</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback1.png" /></p>

					<p><b>NOTE:</b> Make sure all programs are closed and no files are open during this operation. Do not interfere with this process or you risk corrupting your restore point.</p>
					<p>Under <b>Point Operations</b>, click on <b>Create new</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback2.png" /></p>

					<p>This will take some time, so please be patient.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback3.png" /></p>

					<p>Once that has finished, the new restore point will appear under <b>Restore points</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback4.png" /></p>

					<p><b><a name="systembackret">Returning to a Restore Point</a></b></p>

					<p>Click on <b>Menu, System, Systemback</b>. Enter your password and click on <b>OK</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback1.png" /></p>

					<p>Under <b>Restore points</b>, select a restore point date that you want to return to and click on <b>System restore</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback4a.png" /></p>

					<p>Leave the settings untouched as they are in the image below.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback5.png" /></p>

					<p>Now click on <b>Next</b>.</p>
					<p>You will get a confirmation message like the one below. When you are ready, click on <b>Start</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback6.png" /></p>

					<p>The restore process will take some time, so please be patient.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback7.png" /></p>

					<p>Once the restore has completed, you will get a countdown dialogue telling you the computer will restart with 30 seconds.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback8.png" /></p>

					<p>Once your computer has restared, it will be returned to the restore point you created.</p>

					<p><b><a name="systembackiso">Creating a Live ISO of your installation</a></b></p>

					<p>Once you have set up your system up exactly as you want it with all of your programs installed, you can then create a live ISO that you can burn to USB or DVD. 
					If your system becomes corrupted, or you want to share your custom creation with others, or you want the same installation on multiple computers in a business or organization environment, 
					the following tutorial will get you there.</p>

					<p><b>NOTE:</b> Make sure all programs are closed and no files are open during this operation. Do not interfere with this process or you risk corrupting your ISO image.</p>

					<p>Click on <b>Menu, System, Systemback</b>. Enter your password and click on <b>OK</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback1.png" /></p>

					<p>From the main window, select <b>Live system create</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback9.png" /></p>

					<p>Leave the options as they are shown in the image below. When you are ready, click on <b>Create new</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback10.png" /></p>

					<p>The image creation process will take some time, so please be patient.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback11.png" /></p>

					<p>Once the image has been created, click on <b>OK</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback12.png" /></p>

					<p>Now click on and highlight the image under <b>Created Live Images</b> then click on <b>Convert to ISO</b>.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback13.png" /></p>

					<p>The ISO conversion process will take some time, so please be patient.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback14.png" /></p>

					<p>Next, open your home folder and click the up arrow under the menu. This will show you the location of the ISO image.</p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/systemback/systemback15.png" /></p>

					<p>You can now burn the the ISO image with your favorite ISO burning software. We recommend you to use the ones shown <a href="install.html#lldvdwin" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<p><h2><a name="keepassx">KeePassX</a></h2></p>
					<p>KeePassX is a password manager program used for securely creating and storing passwords. It includes a password generator
					that will create strong passwords for you. When using KeePassX, you only need to remember one password - the one
					you use for opening the program. Once your KeePassX data file is opened, transferring a password from the program to its entry form is done quickly
					and easily with a few mouse clicks.</p>

					<p>To install, go to <b>Menu, System, Lite Software</b>, type the number corresponding to KeePassX from the list shown
					in the pop-up window and enter your password when prompted for it.</p>

					<p>After it's installed you can start it from <b>Menu, Accessories, KeePassX</b>. On your first startup you will need to create a new database
					for your passwords - click the interface button for that in the upper-left corner.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-01.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>You will then be prompted to make a master password for the database that will contain your passwords. This is the only password
					you will need to remember. Do your best to make one that you not only can remember, but is strong also. Make it reasonably long with a
					combination of letters, numbers and other characters if possible.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-02.png" /></p>

					<p>After entering your password you will see that the database is now populated with two <b>groups</b> shown on the left: <b>Internet</b> and
					<b>eMail</b>. Groups are just ways to organize your passwords according to their use. (You can edit, delete and create new groups
					by clicking <b>'Groups'</b> along the top of the window.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-03.png" /></p>

					<p>To create a password entry, click the '<b>Add New Entry</b>' button along the top.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-04.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>Select which group the password should fall under, fill-in your information, then enter your password (if you already have one) or click on
					the <b>'Gen'</b> button to bring up the <b>Password Generator</b> to make one for you.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-05.png" /></p>

					<p>In the <b>Password Generator</b> you can specify the types of characters to include, the password length, etc. along with the option
					to enable entropy collection to further strengthen the password.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-06.png" /></p>

					<p>If you enable <b>entropy collection</b> move your mouse around randomly when the collection window pops up.
					The mouse data will be incorporated by the algorithm to produce the random password.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-07.png" /></p>

					<p>When it's done, hit '<b>OK</b>' and it will fill-in the password it produced for you.If you would like to see it, click the eye symbol next to
					the password box.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-08.png" /></p>

					<p>Click '<b>OK</b>' when you are satisfied with everything, your new password entry will now appear in the list for the group you put
					it under. When you are done making your entries (or changes to existing ones), make sure to save everything by
					clicking the <b>Save Database</b> button along the top of the window.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-09.png" /></p>

					<p>A dialog box will pop-up for you to specify a name for the file and where to save it. It will automatically put the '.kdb'
					(keepassx data base) extension on the file name and it will default to saving it in your home folder. (You can
					designate a different location to save to if you'd like.)  So the example below will save a file called 'my-keepassx-data.kdb' under /home/bill.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-10.png" /></p>

					<p><b>VERY IMPORTANT!</b><br />
					<u>Be sure to make at least one extra copy of your '.kdb' file to an external source, like a USB backup stick.</u> If
					your hard drive fails, or something else goes wrong that prevents you from retrieving your files you will lose all of your passwords and access to the
					accounts you set them for. That will not be a pleasant experience if you don't have a backup copy made - so do that immediately and
					update it everytime you make changes to the database.</p>

					<p><b>Using KeePassX is simple!</b></p>
					<p>Start KeePassX and highlight the site you want to log into. Navigate to the website, then click the <b>person icon</b> along the top of the
					KeePassX window to copy your username to the clipboard temporarily. Right-click in the website entry field
					for it and paste. Click the <b>key icon</b> (next to the person icon) to copy the password to the clipboard and paste it into the website
					password field. That's all there is to it (Note:  the information is automatically deleted from the clipboard after 20 seconds.
					You can change that and other settings by going to <b>Extras, Settings, Security</b>.)</p>

					<!-- <p><h2><a name="plank">Plank Dock</a></h2></p>
					<p>Plank is a lightweight docking application for program launchers and works
				well with the Xfce desktop used in Linux Lite. Conveniently add launchers for
				all of your favorite programs on the launcher for quick, easy access. The Plank
				dock can be positioned along any edge of the screen. You can start the dock
				from the main menu or have it start automatically upon boot-up of the computer.</p>
				<p>Plank is one of the applications you can add easily from the <b>Install
				Additional Software</b> section in the <b>Menu</b>. The Plank
				installer in Linux Lite will also download and install many different themes
				for the dock and put a dark <b>plank-themer-ondock</b> icon on the
				dock, which you can click to list and choose from the different themes.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/themer_icon.png" alt="themer_icon.png" /></p>
				<p>The dock themes will not display properly unless <i>compositing</i> is enabled;
				so do the following to make sure you have it enabled.</p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>, then choose
				<b>Window Manager Tweaks</b>.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/win_mgr_tweaks.png" alt="win_mgr_tweaks.png" /></p>
				<p>Click the <b>Compositor</b> tab and click '<b>Enable display compositing</b>'.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/compositor.png" alt="compositor.png" /></p>
				<p>Now you're ready to install Plank. Go to <b>Menu, System,
				Install Additional Software</b> and choose <b>Plank Dock</b> from
				the applications listed in the pop-up.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/install_plank.png" alt="install_plank.png" /></p>
				<p>When installation is complete you will find <b>Plank</b> listed under
				<b>Menu, Accessories</b>.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/menu_plank.png" alt="menu_plank.png" /></p>
				<p><b>POSITIONING THE DOCK</b></p>
				<p>Plank's default position is centered along the bottom of your screen display.
				If your panel is also along the bottom it will block part of the dock. You will
				need to move either the dock or the panel to a different position. Either one
				of them can be moved to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/plank-01.png" border="1" alt="plank-01.png" /></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Panel:</span></b>
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Right-click an empty area on the panel</li>
							<li>Choose: <b>Panel, Panel Preferences, Display (tab)</b></li>
							<li>Uncheck the "Lock Panel" box</li>
							<li>With mouse, grab either <u>end</u> of the panel to move it</li>
							<li>Lock the panel again after move to new position</li>
							<li>Note:  change <b>'Mode'</b> to 'Deskbar' or 'Vertical' if you want the
							panel on one of the sides of the display.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<br />
					<li><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Plank Dock:</span></b>
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Open your file manager, click <b>View, Show Hidden Files</b></li>
							<li>Navigate to <b>.config/plank/dock1</b> and open the <b>settings</b>
							file (with <b>leafpad</b> text editor).</li>
							<li>Or, from <b>Terminal</b> enter this command:  <code>
							<span class="auto-style1"><b>leafpad
							~/.config/plank/dock1/settings</b></span></code></li>
							<li>In opened <b>settings</b> file (see pic below under 'All Other Plank
							Dock Settings' heading):
								<ul>
									<li>Change value in line #18 according to the description on previous line #17</li>
									<li>Save the file</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>If setting did not take immediate effect, right-click the <b>Plank</b>
							icon on the dock and select 'Quit' to close the dock.</li>
							<li>Re-start the dock from <b>Menu, Accessories, Plank</b></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-1.png" alt="plank_settings-1.png" /></p>
				<p>After the move operation you will be able to see the dock properly.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/plank-02.png" border="1" alt="plank-02.png" /></p>
				<p><b>ADDING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS TO THE DOCK</b></p>
				<p>When you open a program from the Menu it will then appear on the dock. When you close
				the application its icon will then disappear from the dock. For programs you use often,
				you'll want to keep them on the dock for easy access so you don't need to navigate the
				Menu. There are two basic ways to accomplish that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open a program through the <b>Menu</b>, right-click the icon that appears
					on the dock and choose 'Keep in Dock'.</li>
					<li>Open the <b>Menu</b>, find program to add, then drag it and drop it
					on the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p><b>REMOVING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS FROM THE DOCK</b></p>
				<p>Two ways to remove items from the dock are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Right-click the launcher icon and un-select 'Keep on Dock'.</li>
					<li>Simply grab, drag and drop the icon somewhere off of the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p><b>ARRANGING LAUNCHER POSITIONS ON THE DOCK</b></p>
				<p>You can change the order of items on the dock by grabbing them with
				your mouse and moving them to the right or left and dropping them
				into place. The dark <b>plank-themer-ondock</b> icon is
				the only one you can not grab. To change its position on the dock,
				move the other icons to its left or right until it ends up where you'd
				like it to reside.</p>
				<p><b>CHANGING THE DOCK'S THEME</b></p>
				<p>Click on the dark <b>themer</b> icon to see a list of almost
				30 themes to choose from. Click the one you want and the dock will
				change to it without the need for a restart of Plank. Here are a few
				theme examples.</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/theme-1.png" border="1" alt="theme-1.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/theme-2.png" border="1" alt="theme-2.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/theme-3.png" border="1" alt="theme-3.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/theme-4.png" border="1" alt="theme-4.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/theme-5.png" border="1" alt="theme-5.png" /></p>
				<br />
				<p><b>LAUNCHING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM</b></p>
				<p>When you click the launcher of a program that is already running, it
				will bring that running window into focus on the screen (bring it to
				the foreground). If instead you would like to launch another instance of
				the program then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Middle mouse click on the launcher icon, or</li>
					<li>Use 'Ctrl' key while left-clicking the icon with your mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p><b>SETUP PLANK TO START AUTOMATICALLY ON BOOT</b></p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application
				Autostart (tab)</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hit '+' button to add new startup entry</li>
					<li><b>Name</b> = Plank Dock</li>
					<li><b>Description</b> = Start Plank dock on startup</li>
					<li><b>Command</b> = plank</li>
					<li>Click 'OK' when done</li>
				</ul><br />
				<p>Close the <b>Session and Startup</b> window when done. Your next
				reboot will start Plank automatically.</p><br />
				<p><b>ALL OTHER PLANK DOCK SETTINGS</b></p>
				<p>All other settings can be adjusted through the dock's <b>
				settings</b>
				file. Use your file manager or the terminal to open file located in the
				<code><span class="auto-style1"><b>~/.config/plank/dock1</b></span></code> directory. (Remember to set file manager
				to 'View Hidden Files'.)  You can edit various lines in the file to make your changes.
				If changes do not take effect immediately after saving the changed file, quit and
				restart Plank. Please refer to the following picture while reading about the various
				settings that can be changed.</p>
				<p>(Note: we hope to have a working GUI interface for these settings available
				within a couple of months, time permitting.)</p>
				<p><img src="images/tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-2.png" alt="plank_settings-2.png" /></p>
				<p>Changes that you can make by editing the <b>settings</b>
				file are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>(Lines #5-6) Show only windows of the current workspace on the dock.
						<ul>
							<li>False = icons show on dock for programs opened on any workspace</li>
							<li>True = only icons for the current workspace show on the dock</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />

					<p><h2><a name="vbox">VirtualBox</a></h2></p>
					<p>The VirtualBox (VirtualBox) program allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container
					of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal
					hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM).</p>

					<p>You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO
					file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment -
					just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer.</p>

					<p><b>Some common uses for VirtualBox are:</b></p>
					<p>- Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation.<br />
					- Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer.<br />
					- Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes.<br />
					- Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer.<br />
					(Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.)</p>

					<p><b>Installing VirtualBox</b></p>
					<p>To install VirtualBox, go to <b>Menu, System, Lite Software</b> and find it from the list of software to install.
					Enter its corresponding number and your password when asked for it. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to
					fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-01.png" /></p>

					<p>After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the <b>Accessories</b> and <b>System</b> sections of the <b>Menu</b>.</p>
					<p>VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start
					VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support.</p>

					<p><b>NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is
					provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time.</b></p>

					<p>You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching "Extension Pack". It should be
					version 4.3.10; but double-check that by clicking <b>Help, About VirtualBox</b> from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of
					pop-up window for the version number.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-02.png" /></p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-03.png" /></p>

					<p>For the latest version, go to this <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> webpage. Otherwise, go
					<a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/" target="_blank">here</a>, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to
					continue.</p>
					<p>Find the "Extension Pack" listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on <b>All supported platforms</b> to download it. Save
					the download to your Downloads folder.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-04.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-05.png" /></p>

					<p>Once downloaded, in VirtualBox main window, go to <b>File, Preferences</b> and click <b>Extensions</b> on the left side.</p>
					<p>Look to the right side of the window and you will see two icons. Click the top icon to <b>Add Package</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-06.png" alt="vbox-06.png" /></p>

					<p>It will open your <b>Downloads</b> folder. Click to highlight the extension pack you just downloaded. Click <b>Open</b> to install it to VirtualBox.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-07.png" /></p>

					<p>A window will appear confirming that you want to install the extension pack. Click <b>Install</b>, then scroll down the
					license agreement and hit <b>I Agree</b> to the terms of use.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-08.png" /></p>

					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-09.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>Enter your password when asked for it and finish the installation. When complete, you will see the extension pack added
					under Extensions in the VirtualBox Preferences, (VirtualBox main window: <b>File, Preferences</b>).</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-10.png" /></p>

					<p><b>Using VirtualBox</b></p>
					<p>VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a
					downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started.</p>

					<p>From main VirtualBox window, click the <b>New</b> button to make a new virtual machine environment.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-11.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>Next, choose a <b>Name</b> for the virtual machine, the <b>Type</b> of operating system it	will be, and
					<b>Version</b> of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and
					choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the <b>Version</b> drop-down box.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-12.png" /></p>

					<p>In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called <b>Voyager</b> and we are using its 64-bit version. There
					is no listing for Voyager, so we'll just choose <b>Ubuntu 64-bit</b> because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine
					[VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click <b>Next</b> to continue.</p>

					<p>Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not
					dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is
					operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer has
					8GB of RAM, so 2GB was allotted to the VM.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-13.png" /></p>

					<p>The next screen asks if you want to <b>Create a virtual hard drive now</b>. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click <b>Create</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-14.png" /></p>

					<p>We'll choose <b>VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)</b> from the <b>Hard Drive File Type</b> screen.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-15.png" /></p>

					<p>We'll choose <b>Dynamically allocated</b> from the <b>Storage on physical hard drive</b> screen.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-16.png" /></p>

					<p>On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be
					sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-17.png" /></p>

					<p>After hitting <b>Create </b>your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just
					an empty container.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-18.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM
					and click <b>Settings</b>. Then, click <b>Display</b> along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default
					is 12MB, we'll give it 64MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either <b>3-D</b> or <b>2-D Acceleration</b>. (If one gives you an "invalid
					settings" message, unclick it and choose the other.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-19.png" /></p>

					<p>Now, click <b>USB</b> on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-20.png" border="1" /></p>

					<p>Click <b>OK</b> when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the <b>Start</b>
					arrow to begin installation.</p>
					<p>The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already
					listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit <b>Start</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-21.png" /></p>

					<p>In this example, we are using an ISO file that has been downloaded to the hard drive. For that, click the icon to the right
					of the CD/DVD drive box to bring up a window for navigating to the location where you saved the ISO file.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-22.png" /></p>

					<p>After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit <b>Start</b> and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-23.png" /></p>

					<p>When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process
					is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. All references on the "Installation Type" screen are to the virtual
					hard drive. When asked if you want to "Erase disk and install", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about
					the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.)</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-24.png" /></p>

					<p>After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse
					somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the "x" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the
					machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the <b>Start</b> arrow again.</p>

					<p>In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and
					it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD.</p>

					<p>Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM
					window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.)</p>

					<p><b>Using USB's in VirtualBox</b></p>
					<p>Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox "Extension Pack",to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username
					to the "<b>vboxusers</b>" group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.)  You should
					perform the following steps while no VM's are open.</p>

					<p>Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b> and select the <b>User Manager</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-25.png" /></p>

					<p>With your username showing under <b>Select user</b>, scroll down the list in the <b>Groups</b> column and place
					a check in the box next to <b>vboxusers</b> to add yourself to that group and hit <b>Apply</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-26.png" /></p>

					<p>Close out the User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs.</p>
					<p>Log out of computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect.</p>
					<p>Open VirtualBox and start your new VM.</p>
					<p>Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB
					you want to use.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-27.png" /></p>

					<p>Catfish is an easy to use GUI file search utility found under <b>Menu, Accessories, File Search</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/catfish/catfish-menu.png" /></p>

					<p>Upon opening Catfish, you will see this file search window:</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/catfish/catfish-01.png" /></p>

					<p>Catfish uses the <i>locate</i> command to search for files. The locate command relies on a database it maintains of the files on your computer.
					That database gets automatically updated periodically - normally once a day. Before conducting a search it is a good idea to manually update
					the database index to make sure that any file changes made since the last update are reflected in the search results. Click the gear icon
					in upper-right corner and choose <b>Update Search Index</b>.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/catfish/catfish-02.png" /></p>

					<p>You can also use the gear button for other options like displaying advanced settings in the search window. The advanced settings display
					lets you filter search results by file modification dates, file types, file extensions, etc.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/catfish/catfish-03.png" /></p>

					<p>The example below shows a search in my Home folder for any file with "song" in the file name.</p>
					<p><img src="images/tutorials/catfish/catfish-04.png" /></p>

					<p>To limit the results to only music files, simply click "Music" under "File Type" in the advanced settings.</p>
